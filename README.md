# weathercheck
a program to record temperatures and display them in a matplotlib graph.

How to use :
------------
Started first "tempodata.py" to introduce data in console mode. It at 
least enter 2 days for the program to work (otherwise it serves no purpose).

This program works in the following order :
1)tempodata.py --> 2)aspidata.py --> 3)plot_prog.py

Ideally, values should be entered in order and at the end of a month.

It is also possible to run "plot_prog.py" to see the graph with matplotlib.
To do that, you just have to use the program at least once.

My goal is to perform this program in GUI mode with tkinter.

Hope that serve you!

Enjoy it!
